Client Identification and Recognition of need
The old manual system was suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since whole of the system was to be maintained with hands the process of keeping, maintaining and retrieving the information was very tedious and lengthy.
 The records were never used to be in a systematic order. there used to be lots of difficulties in associating any particular transaction with a particular contest. If any information was to be found it was required to go through the different registers, documents there would never exist anything like report generation.
 There would always be unnecessary consumption of time while entering records and retrieving records. One more problem was that it was very difficult to find errors while entering the records.
 Once the records were entered it was very difficult to update these records. The reason behind it is that there is lot of information to be maintained and have to be kept in mind while running the business .
For this reason we have provided features Present system is partially automated (computerized), actually existing system is quite laborious as one has to enter same information at three different places.






Recognition and Knowledge of Contemporary issues

Analysts working on the preliminary investigation should accomplish the
following objectives:

•	Clarify and understand the project request
•	Determine the size of the project.
•	Assess costs and benefits of alternative approaches.
•	Detemiine the technical and operational feasibility of altemative approaches.
•	Report the findings to management, with recommendations outlining the acceptance or rejection of the proposal.
•	Benefit to Organization:  The organization will obviously be able to gain benefits such as savings in operating cost, reduction in paperwork, better utilization of human resources and more presentable image Increasing goodwill.
•	The Initial Cost: The initial cost of setting up the system will include the cost of hardware software (OS, add-on software, utilities) & labour(setup & maintenance). The same has to bear by the organization.
•	Running Cost: Besides, the initial cost the long term cost will include the running cost for the system including the AMC, statonary charges, cost for human resources, cost for update/renewal of various related software.
•	Need for Training:  The users along with the administrator need to be trained at the time of implementation of the system for smooth running of the system. The client will provide the training site.
We talked to the management people who were managing a the financial issues of the center, the staff who were keeping the records in lots of registers and the reporting manager regarding their existing system, their requirements and their expectations from the new proposed system. Then, we did the system study of the entire system based on their requirements and the additional features they wanted to incorporate in this system.
Reliable, accurate and secure data was also considered to be a complex task without this proposed system. Because there was no such record for keeping track of all the activities, which was done by the Paying Guest Booking System on the daily basis.
The new system proposed and then developed by me will ease the task of the organization in consideration. It will be helpful in generating the required reports by the staff, which will help them to track their progress and services. Thus, it will ease the task of Management to a great extent as all the major activities to be performed, are computerized through the system.
